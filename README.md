# tic-tac-toe
ðŸŽ® Just built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML! ðŸŽ®

I had a great time working on this fun project. It gave me hands-on experience with:

Event handling in JavaScript
DOM manipulation
Styling with CSS
Game logic implementation
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, and I learned a lot about how to manage interactivity in web development.

Excited to work on more challenging projects in the future! ðŸš€
